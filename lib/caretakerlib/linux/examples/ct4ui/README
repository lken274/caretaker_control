This is a sample qt application illustrating use of libcaretaker to montior the Caretaker device.

1. Setup environment
--------------------
Before running the qt app, you will need to setup bluetooth. You may need a USB-BLE dongle for this;
if so, plug the dongle into a USB port on your computer and then run the following commands to
configure the dongle. Replace <hci-n> with the correct device name printed in the hcitool output for
the dongle.

    hcitool dev
    sudo hciconfig <hci-n> reset

The qtcreator tool is also required. Execute the following command to install qtcreator on your Ubuntu
or Debian computer if not already installed.

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install qtcreator
    sudo apt-get install qt5-default

2. Build ct4ui app
------------------
Change directory to the top-level ct4ui directory containing this readme file and then run the
following commands to build the app.

	make clean
	make


3. Run ct4ui app
----------------
The application uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with the Caretaker device, which
requires root permission. So you must run the app as root, which can be done using sudo on Ubuntu
linux.

    sudo ./run_ct4ui.sh


4. Modifying the app
--------------------
If you would like to modify the sample ct4ui app, start qtcreator and open the ct4ui project.

    qtcreator &

Note if running the app from qtcreator, you will need to setup root permission in the IDE, which can
be accomplished as follows.

    1. Go to Tools-> Options-> Environment
    2. In the Tab General under "System" Group, modify the Terminal Option.
       Replace the default with /usr/bin/xterm -e sudo.
    3. Press Apply and OK Buttons.
    4. Under Mode Selector click on Projects, select Run Option. Under Run Group Box select Run in
       Terminal.

After the above setup, running the app from the IDE starts a terminal that prompts you for the
password, enter the password when prompted.
