This sample application is a C# application illustrating use of libcaretaker_clr to monitor the
Caretaker device. This application illustrates using the Caretaker.DeviceObserver asynchronous
interface for monitoring.
 
1. Setup
---------
Setup Bluetooth on a Windows 10 PC that will run the sample application. Plug TI CC2540 dongle or
similar dongle into a USB port on the PC then install the necessary drivers. After successful setup,
the dongle will appear as a virtual COM port that the application will use to communicate with the
Caretaker device. Note the library automatically detects the dongle, so after setup you only need
to plug it into the PC then run the sample application.
 
Additionally, download and install the following programs on the PC to build the application.
 
	* Visual Studio 2017 or later
	* .NET Framework 4.0 or later
	* Common Language Runtime (CLR) 4.0
 
 
2. Building the sample application
----------------------------------
Start Visual Studio 2017 and open CaretakerCSharpSampleApp.sln. Set the active solution to x64
then click Build->Rebuild Solution in the tool bar to build the sample App.
 
 
3. Running the sample application
---------------------------------
Plug the BLE dongle into the PC.
 
Next, start the sample application from the Visual Studio IDE using the Local Windows Debugger play
button, or by double-clicking the CaretakerCSharpSampleApp.exe located in the bin directory.
 
Next, enter the Caretaker serial number into the connect text box located in the status bar, then
press the Connect button to start connecting. The status bar changes to blue after the connection
is established.
 
Note you must press the Caretaker device button for the device to connect to the App. The device
displays an orange BLE icon when it is advertising for a connection, and the icon turns blue after
the connection is established.
 
Next, attach the finger cuff then press the App Start button to start a calibration and then take
measurements.
