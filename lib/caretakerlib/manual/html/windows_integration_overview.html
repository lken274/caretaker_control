<h2>Supported Communication Protocols</h2>
<p>The Caretaker4 supports only Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication. However, the Careataker5 supports BLE, Wi-FI, and USB communication.</p>
<h3>BLE Communication</h3>
<p>For BLE connectivity, some BLE setup is required on the PC prior to connecting the application to the Caretaker device. Native Windows BLE is not supported in this release of the Caretaker library so an external BLE dongle is required. The supported dongles are TI CC2540 dongles. (Note Bluegiga BLE112 dongles also work but have shorter range.) Plug the dongle into a USB port on the PC and install the necessary drivers. You can find more information about the TI CC2540 driver here <em><a href="https://www.ti.com/tool/BLE-STACK-ARCHIVE">https://www.ti.com/tool/BLE-STACK-ARCHIVE</a></em>.</p>
<p>After successful setup, the dongle will appear as <em>TI CC2540 USB CDC Serial Port (COMxx)</em> in the Device Manager <em>Ports (COM &amp; LPT)</em>. The library will detect the dongle automatically when it is plugged into the PC thereafter.</p>
<h3>Wi-Fi Communication</h3>
<p>For Wi-Fi connectivity to Caretaker, the Linux computer and the Caretaker must be configured to join the same network. Note the Caretaker supports peer-to-peer Wi-Fi connectivity via a private network that can be enabled from the Caretaker settings menu. If enabled, the PC must also be configured to join the private peer-to-peer network for connectivity with the Caretaker.</p>
<h3>USB Communication</h3>
<p>For USB connectivity, plug the Caretaker into the PC using a standard USB-C to USB-A cable. For Windows 10 and later versions, a generic USB serial driver is installed automatically when the Caretaker is first plugged into the PC. The device will appear as <em>USB Serial Device (COMX)</em> under the Device Manager <em>Ports (COM &amp; LPT)</em>.</p>
<p>However, for Windows 8.1 and earlier versions, the USB serial driver must be installed manually. After plugging the Caretaker into the PC, open the Device Manager and identify the Caretaker. Next right-click to install the provided USB serial driver <em>ctm_usb_cdc.inf</em>. The device will then appear as <em>Vitalstream USB Serial (COMX)</em> under the Device Manager <em>Ports (COM &amp; LPT)</em>.</p>
<p>After the USB serial driver is installed, the library will detect the Caretaker automatically when it is plugged into the PC.</p>
<h2>Software Dependencies</h2>
<p>Install <em>Microsoft Visual Studio 2015</em> or later, or <em>Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable</em> or later to install the runtime environment required to load and run applications linked with the Caretaker library. Note the application will fail to start if the required runtime environment is not installed.</p>
<h2>Linking with the Managed Library</h2>
<p>Use the Common Language Runtime (CLR) wrapper library (libcaretaker_clr.dll) to integrate .NET Framework 4.0+, .Net Core 3.0+, or .Net 5.0+ applications with the Caretaker device. Copy both libcaretaker_clr.dll (managed library) and libcaretaker_dynamic.dll (unmanaged library) to the application project directory then add a reference to libcareteker_clr.dll. For Visual Studio projects, the reference can be added by right-clicking the application project then selecting Add Reference and then browsing to libcaretaker_clr.dll and selecting it.</p>
<p>Note both DLLs will be loaded at runtime when the application is executed and are expected to be located with the application executable (.exe) file. So they must be copied to the directory where the executable file is saved. The copy can be done manually after building the application, or the build can be configured to copy them automatically. For Visual Studio, this can be done by right-clicking the project, then selecting Properties, then Build Events, and add the following Post-build event command line.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">copy /B /Y <span class="stringliteral">&quot;$(ProjectDir)libcaretaker_dynamic.dll&quot;</span> <span class="stringliteral">&quot;$(TargetDir)&quot;</span></div></div><!-- fragment --><h2>Linking with the Unmanaged Library</h2>
<p>Native Windows applications can link with the unmanaged library using either implicit or explicit linking. The Win64 library binary must be used when linking with Win64 applications, and the Win32 library binary must be used when linking with Win32 applications.</p>
<h3>Implicit Linking</h3>
<p>Add the following files to the application project for static linking with the library. </p><ul>
<li>
caretaker_static.h </li>
<li>
libcaretaker_static.lib </li>
</ul>
<p>The caretaker_static.h file contains the exported library functions that are callable from within the application. Add it to the application source (or include) folder and then include it in each source file that will call library functions. </p>
<p>Add the libcaretaker_static.lib file to the application source (or lib) directory and include it in the library path where the linker can find it. If using an external makefile, add libcaretaker_static.lib where the object files (.obj) and other libraries are listed. If Visual Studio, add it to the project Linker Input configuration where the other libraries are listed.</p>
<h3>Explicit Linking</h3>
<p>Add the following files to the application project for dynamic linking with the library. </p><ul>
<li>
caretaker_dynamic.h </li>
<li>
libcaretaker_dynamic.dll </li>
</ul>
<p>The caretaker_dynamic.h file contains the exported library functions that are callable from within the application. Add it to the application source (or include) folder and then include it in each source file that will call library functions. </p>
<p>Additionally, the application must explicitly load and unload the <em>libcaretaker_dynamic.dll</em> at runtime. </p><ul>
<li>
Call Windows LoadLibrary() to load the DLL and obtain a module handle. </li>
<li>
Call Windows GetProcAddress() to obtain a function pointer to each exported function that the application will call. </li>
<li>
Call Windows FreeLibrary() when done with the DLL. </li>
</ul>
<p>See the native C++ sample application for illustration.</p>
<h2>Debugging</h2>
<p>The library supports generating log messages with the following levels of verbosity.</p>
<table class="doxtable">
<tr>
<th>Log Level </th><th>Description </th></tr>
<tr>
<td>0 </td><td>Show all log messages. This is the most verbose level. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>1 </td><td>Show informational, warning, and error messages only. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>2 </td><td>Show warning and error messages only. </td></tr>
<tr>
<td>3 </td><td>Show error messages only. This is the least verbose level. </td></tr>
</table>
<p>The application can call the managed CareTaker.Device.SetLibraryLogLevel() API or the unmanaged <a class="el" href="group__unmanaged__secondary__api.html#ga0f4a1a0099592a7a0ddb1053d7a7e888" title="Sets the library log level. ">libct_set_log_level()</a> API to set the log level.</p>
<p>Log messages are written to standard output by default and will be printed to the console if the application was started there. The application can redirect library logs to a file as follows.</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Managed application code to redirect library logs to libcaretaker.log</span></div><div class="line"><a class="code" href="namespaceCaretaker.html">Caretaker</a>.<a class="code" href="classCaretaker_1_1Device.html">Device</a>.<a class="code" href="classCaretaker_1_1Device.html#a6cd9baaa21c213cb11b3fcea0a501f29">RedirectLibraryLogs</a>();</div></div><!-- fragment --><div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="comment">// Unmanaged application code to redirect library logs to libcaretaker.log</span></div><div class="line">FILE* logStream = NULL;</div><div class="line">freopen_s(&amp;logStream, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;libcaretaker.log&quot;</span>, <span class="stringliteral">&quot;w&quot;</span>, stdout);</div></div><!-- fragment --><p>Note log messages from the unmanaged library code will have the following format.</p>
